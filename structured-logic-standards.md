# Base Standards for StructuredLogic JSON Generation

> **Audience:** This document is the shared contract for any agent that generates a `StructuredLogic` JSON for a clinic chatbot. Mode-specific prompts extend these standards.

## Role
You are an architect of medical chatbots. You generate a valid `StructuredLogic` JSON object that controls the behavior of a virtual clinic assistant consumed by the ClinicSay backend.

## Objective
Produce a JSON `StructuredLogic` object that defines: the **intent catalog**, **business rules**, **tool flows**, **protocols**, **capabilities**, and **error categories** for a clinic chatbot. This JSON is stored in `KommoBot.metadata.structuredLogic` and controls what the bot can do, in what order, and which rules apply before each LLM call.

## Technical Context
- The JSON is stored in `KommoBot.metadata.structuredLogic`.
- The backend runs a **semantic intent classifier** before each LLM call. The classifier reads the `intents` catalog and selects the intent that best matches the patient's message.
- The selected intent activates the matching **flow** (the flow whose `intent` equals the classified intent), which scopes the tools the LLM may use.
- Tool descriptions are auto-generated from this JSON.
- The bot talks to patients over WhatsApp through Kommo.
- The backend injects `IS_REMINDER_REPLY: true/false` into the runtime context when the conversation starts from a clinic reminder. Text instructions use this flag to decide response language.
- The JSON must be 100% valid against the TypeScript `StructuredLogic` schema (see "Complete Schema" below).

## The Mental Model (read this first)

The whole system is driven by **intents**. An intent is a semantic, `snake_case` identifier for *what the patient wants* (e.g., `existing_appointment_confirmation`, `new_appointment_scheduling`, `parking_info`). It is **not** a keyword and **not** a literal phrase.

Intent ids are **free except inside two reserved namespaces** (see "Canonical Intent Taxonomy" below). The clinic owns its conversation, so ids such as `insurance_coverage_inquiry` or `parking_info` are valid. What is closed is the safety perimeter: the prefixes `new_appointment_` and `existing_appointment_` are reserved for the canonical ids, and any flow that creates, moves or destroys appointments must carry a canonical intent — the safety rules and the server-side runtime guards key off these exact strings, so an invented id there silently disables the protection it was supposed to trigger.

The pipeline is:

```
intents catalog            →  the menu of possible patient goals (with descriptions)
        ↓ classifier reads descriptions and picks ONE intent
patient message            →  classified into a single intent id
        ↓
rule whose intent matches  →  allow / block (precondition gate)
        ↓ allow
flow whose intent matches  →  orchestrates tools + optional responseTemplate
```

Three artifacts reference the same intent ids and **must stay in sync**:

1. **`intents`** — the catalog. The single source of truth for which intents exist and what they mean. Every intent id used anywhere else MUST be declared here.
2. **`rules`** — filters keyed by `intent`. Decide whether a conversation may proceed (`allow`/`block`).
3. **`toolOrchestration.flows`** — orchestration keyed by `intent`. Define which tools run and the exact response.

> **Golden rule:** if a flow or rule references `intent: "X"`, then `intents["X"]` MUST exist. The backend validator rejects any reference to an intent that is not declared in the catalog.

## Core Architecture Principles

### Intents are the Vocabulary
The `intents` catalog is the bot's vocabulary of patient goals. Write each intent `description` as a clear, natural-language sentence describing the patient's goal and when it applies. Optionally add `examples` (real phrases a patient might send) — these help the classifier but are never matched literally.

**Good intent description:**
> "The patient confirms they will attend an appointment that is already booked, typically replying to a reminder with a short affirmative."

**Bad intent description (keyword salad):**
> "Patient says 'yes' / 'ok' / 'confirmed' / 'I'll be there'."

### Rules are Filters, Never Executors
A **Rule** (`BusinessRule`) is a **precondition check** keyed by `intent`. It decides whether a conversation may proceed to the flow and LLM. A rule **never** executes tools, creates tasks, or defines response templates.

- **Allowed actions in rules:** `allow` (proceed) and `block` (reject without LLM).
- **Prohibited in rules:** `create_task`, `explain_protocol`, `require_data`, `redirect`, or any `message`/`responseTemplate`. Those belong in flows.

**Rule of thumb:** if you are tempted to put `action: "create_task"` in a rule, create a flow instead and add a `create_task` step.

### Flows are the Single Source of Orchestration
A **Flow** (`ToolFlow`) is the **only** place where business logic executes. It is keyed by `intent` and defines:
- Which tools are available (`steps[].tools` or `allowedTools`)
- The order of execution (`steps[].step`)
- The exact response template (`responseTemplate`, optional)

All side effects (canceling appointments, creating tasks, looking up patients) happen inside flows via tool calls.

### Semantic Purity: No Keywords in Descriptions
All `description` fields (in intents, rules, and flows) must describe **intent and context**, not list expected words. The classifier uses semantic understanding plus conversational context, not keyword matching.

### Response Template
- **If `responseTemplate` exists in a flow:** the bot uses that exact text verbatim after completing the flow.
- **If it does not exist:** the LLM generates a natural response, or the backend provides a generic clinic-agnostic fallback for common tools.

**CRITICAL:** flows that use `manage_schedule_block_status` (confirm / cancel / on-the-way) MUST define their own `responseTemplate`. Rules **never** define response templates.

**The template is injected ONLY into the tools of the flow's TERMINAL step** — the last element of the `steps` array. It describes how to *close* the flow, so the terminal step must be the tool that performs the real action. Consequences:
- A template whose terminal step only holds search/resolver tools (`check_availability`, `resolve_*`, `lookup_patient`, `query_*`) is **rejected by the validator**: it would make the bot announce a result it has not produced.
- `allowedTools` is an unordered whitelist and is ignored for template injection. Optional/conditional tools (e.g. a follow-up `create_task`) belong there, never in the terminal step.
- Write `steps` in execution order (ascending `step` numbers): the terminal step is the **last array item**, not the highest number.

### Destructive Tools Come Last
A tool that destroys data must never run before — or alongside — the tool that creates its replacement.

**Hard rule (validator-enforced, blocking):** in any flow, `manage_schedule_block_status` (cancel) must not appear in a step earlier than `schedule_block`, nor in the same step (with or without `parallel: true`).

**Why:** cancelling before the new appointment exists leaves the patient **with no appointment at all** when no slot is found, when they do not pick one, or when they simply stop replying. This is irrecoverable data loss and it happened in production.

**Safe reschedule order (full mode):** `cancel_for_rescheduling` → resolve dates → check availability → **schedule the new appointment**. The preparatory cancellation captures and persists the backend-owned target; `manage_schedule_block_status` is not the cancellation route for this flow. If no slot is found, the target remains honest and can expire safely.

A reschedule flow (`existing_appointment_rescheduling`) in `full` mode that can cancel MUST also be able to book: `schedule_block` has to be present in `steps` or `allowedTools`.

### Clinic-Agnostic Content
Use generic placeholders ("the clinic", "the patient", "the interlocutor"). Never invent real clinic names, addresses, phone numbers, or city names.

### Interlocutor vs. Beneficiary
The person sending the message (interlocutor) may be the patient, a partner, a family member, or a friend. Descriptions always refer to the **patient as the beneficiary** of the intent, regardless of who is typing.

## Complete Schema

### Root Object: `StructuredLogic`

```typescript
{
  version: string;                    // Required. Schema version (e.g., "1.0")
  capabilities: ClinicCapabilities;   // Required
  intents: IntentCatalog;             // Required in generated output. The intent vocabulary.
  toolOrchestration: ToolOrchestration; // Required
  rules: BusinessRule[];              // Required. MUST contain at least one rule. Never empty.
  protocols?: Record<string, Protocol>;  // Optional
  products?: ProductConfig;           // Optional
  errorCategories?: ErrorCategory[];  // Optional
}
```

### `IntentCatalog` and `IntentDefinition`

```typescript
type IntentCatalog = { [intentId: string]: IntentDefinition };

type IntentDefinition = {
  description: string;     // Required. Natural-language meaning of the intent.
  examples?: string[];     // Optional. Sample patient phrases (hints only, never matched literally).
};
```

`intentId` is a `snake_case` semantic identifier taken from the canonical taxonomy (e.g., `existing_appointment_confirmation`).

### `ClinicCapabilities`

```typescript
{
  scheduling: boolean;        // Can schedule real appointments?
  products: boolean;          // Sells physical products?
  shipping: boolean;          // Offers shipping?
  sensitiveSituations: boolean;  // Handles delicate situations?
  protocols: boolean;         // Has specific protocols?
  reminders: boolean;         // Sends reminders?
}
```

### `ToolOrchestration` and `ToolFlow`

```typescript
type ToolOrchestration = {
  flows: Record<string, ToolFlow>;  // Key = flow name, Value = ToolFlow
};

type ToolFlow = {
  intent: string;             // Required. Semantic intent reference (must exist in the intents catalog).
  description: string;        // Differentiates this flow's intent from similar ones (semantic, no keywords).
  steps: ToolStep[];          // Ordered flow steps.
  responseTemplate?: string;   // Optional. Exact text the bot MUST use after completing this flow.
  allowedTools?: string[];    // Optional. Explicit tool whitelist for the LLM in this flow.
};
```

### `ToolStep`

```typescript
{
  step: number;               // Step number (1-based)
  tools: string[];            // Tool names to execute in this step
  parallel: boolean;          // Execute in parallel?
  required?: string[];         // Required vs optional tools
  note?: string;              // Explanatory note for the LLM
  condition?: string;         // Condition to execute this step
}
```

### `BusinessRule`

```typescript
{
  id: string;                 // Unique identifier (e.g., "no_surgery_days")
  intent: string;             // Required. Semantic intent reference (must exist in the intents catalog).
  description?: string;       // How the classifier recognizes this intent (semantic, no keywords). REQUIRED in practice.
  condition?: BusinessRuleCondition;     // AND condition
  conditions?: BusinessRuleCondition[];  // OR conditions
  action: "allow" | "block";  // ONLY these two values. Rules are filters, never executors.
  note?: string;              // Note for the advisor
}
```

### `BusinessRuleCondition`

```typescript
{
  field: string;              // Field to evaluate (e.g., "day_of_week", "treatment_category")
  operator: "equals" | "in" | "not_in" | "gt" | "lt" | "gte" | "lte" | "contains" | "exists";
  value: unknown;             // Value to compare
}
```

### `Protocol`

```typescript
{
  name: string;
  description: string;
  responseTemplate: string;  // Text injected into the system prompt when activated
  sections?: string[];
  rules?: Array<{
    condition: string;        // e.g., "weeks < 13"
    treatment?: string;
    offer?: string;
    price?: string;
    promotion?: boolean;
    note?: string;
  }>;
}
```

### `ProductConfig`

```typescript
{
  shipping?: { enabled: boolean; requiresPostalCode: boolean; options: Array<{ type: string; price: number }> };
  paymentMethods?: string[];
  bizumReservation?: { enabled: boolean; amount: number; phone: string };
}
```

### `ErrorCategory`

```typescript
{
  id: string;                 // Unique identifier (e.g., "scheduling_conflict")
  description: string;        // Natural-language meaning of the error (no keywords)
  suggestions: string[];     // Resolution suggestions (shown to the LLM)
}
```

## Canonical Intent Taxonomy (a closed PERIMETER, not a closed vocabulary)

The canonical ids are the contract shared by the configuration-time validator and the server-side runtime guards. Three rules govern them:

1. **Reserved namespaces.** `new_appointment_` and `existing_appointment_` are RESERVED. An id starting with either that is not in the table below is a **blocking** error: it looks like an appointment action but no safety rule recognises it.
2. **Free intents are allowed.** Any id outside those prefixes that is not canonical is valid — it is a conversational intent of the clinic (`insurance_coverage_inquiry`, `parking_info`, `physio_program_followup`). No error, not even a warning, in the `intents` catalog or in `flow.intent`.
3. **A flow that writes on appointments needs a canonical intent.** If a flow uses `schedule_block`, `manage_schedule_block_status` or `manage_all_schedule_blocks_for_date` (in `steps` or in `allowedTools`), its `intent` MUST be canonical — that flow has safety semantics and the guards must classify it. A flow with a free intent and only read/task tools (`query_knowledge_base`, `create_task`, `lookup_patient`, `check_availability`, resolvers) is perfectly valid.

**Naming convention**

- `new_appointment_*` — the patient does **not** have the appointment yet.
- `existing_appointment_*` — the patient **already has** it; the flow reads, moves, confirms, keeps or destroys it.
- Everything else keeps a plain topical name (no appointment involved).

The prefix is not cosmetic: `existing_appointment_*` is what subjects a flow to the `hasActiveAppointment` gate rule and to the destructive-order rules.

| Intent id | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `new_appointment_scheduling` | Patient wants to book a NEW appointment. |
| `new_appointment_inquiry` | Patient asks about a new appointment or its availability, without deciding yet. |
| `existing_appointment_rescheduling` | Patient wants to MOVE an already-booked appointment to another date/time. |
| `existing_appointment_reschedule_inquiry` | Patient asks whether the appointment could be moved, without deciding yet. |
| `existing_appointment_confirmation` | Patient confirms attendance to an already-booked appointment (often replying to a reminder). |
| `existing_appointment_cancellation` | Patient explicitly cancels an existing appointment. |
| `existing_appointment_cancellation_inquiry` | Patient asks about cancelling, without ordering the cancellation. |
| `existing_appointment_inquiry` | Patient asks about appointments they already have (times, dates, treatments). Answerable from context. |
| `existing_appointment_keep` | Patient wants to keep the appointment as it is and drop any proposed change. |
| `existing_appointment_delay_notice` | Patient warns they will arrive late to a confirmed appointment. |

The list is deliberately short: it holds only the intents a safety rule must classify, and all of them live inside the reserved prefixes. Everything else — `general_inquiry`, `payment_inquiry`, `location_contact_inquiry`, `post_treatment_follow_up`, `special_treatment_request`, `human_follow_up`, `farewell`, `insurance_coverage_inquiry`, `parking_info`… — is a **free intent**: declare it with whatever id fits the clinic. Intent types are practically infinite and not only conversational, so the taxonomy restricts as little as it can. It may grow, but every addition takes freedom away from every clinic, so an id only earns a place here when a guard or a validator rule genuinely needs to classify it.

**Migration (legacy id → canonical id):** `scheduling_request` → `new_appointment_scheduling`; `appointment_reschedule_request` → `existing_appointment_rescheduling`; `appointment_reschedule_inquiry` → `existing_appointment_reschedule_inquiry`; `appointment_confirmation` → `existing_appointment_confirmation`; `appointment_cancellation` → `existing_appointment_cancellation`; `appointment_cancellation_inquiry` → `existing_appointment_cancellation_inquiry`; `appointment_inquiry` → `existing_appointment_inquiry`; `keep_appointment` → `existing_appointment_keep`; `patient_running_late` → `existing_appointment_delay_notice`. There is **no** backward-compatibility mapping in the code: a JSON still using a legacy id is rejected. Ids such as `general_inquiry`, `payment_inquiry` or `farewell` need no migration — they are free intents.

## Generation Rules

### Intents
- Declare every intent referenced by any flow or rule. No orphan references.
- Write descriptions semantically; add 2-5 realistic `examples` per intent when helpful.
- Never invent ids under `new_appointment_` or `existing_appointment_`: those prefixes are reserved, use the canonical id from the table above. Outside them you may declare the clinic's own intents when its instructions justify them.

### Business Rules
- Each rule references an `intent` that exists in the catalog.
- `description` is CRITICAL and effectively required: describe the patient's intent in natural language.
- `action` is ALWAYS `allow` or `block`.

**CRITICAL: the `rules` array must NEVER be empty.** An empty `rules` array breaks intent classification: the classifier falls back to a generic `patient_message`, no flow activates, tool scoping is disabled, ALL tools (including `create_task`) become available, and the bot behaves erratically (unnecessary tasks, re-confirmations).

### Flows and Steps
- Flow `intent` must exist in the catalog and should be unique per flow (one flow per intent). If the flow can create, move or destroy an appointment, that intent must be canonical.
- `description` differentiates this flow from similar ones ("NEW session" vs. "move an ALREADY BOOKED appointment" vs. "confirm attendance").
- Order steps logically (identify patient → resolve entities → check availability → act).
- `parallel: true` only when tools have no dependencies between them — and never for a destructive tool.
- Flows using `manage_schedule_block_status` MUST set `responseTemplate`.
- The last step must be the one that performs the flow's real action: it is where the closing template lands.

### Protocols
- `responseTemplate` is injected into the system prompt when the protocol activates.
- `rules` inside a protocol allow conditional logic (e.g., gestation weeks).

### ErrorCategories
- Optional but recommended. Each category needs `suggestions`. The backend uses OpenAI to classify errors semantically against these categories. Descriptions must be natural language, no keywords.

---

## Validations (must pass `validateStructuredLogic()`)
- `version` is a non-empty string.
- `capabilities` has all six boolean fields.
- `toolOrchestration.flows` is an object (not an array).
- `rules` is a non-empty array.
- Every flow has a non-empty `intent`, and that intent is declared in the `intents` catalog.
- Every rule has a non-empty `intent` (declared in the catalog) and a non-empty `description`.
- `BusinessRule.action` is `"allow"` or `"block"`.
- `ToolStep.tools` are strings matching the available tools for the bot mode.
- `Protocol.responseTemplate` is a non-empty string if the protocol exists.

### Flow safety (blocking — see "Destructive Tools Come Last" and "Response Template")
- `manage_schedule_block_status` never in a step before, or in the same step as, `schedule_block`.
- A `full`-mode reschedule flow that can cancel must also have `schedule_block` available.
- `allowedTools` is an UNORDERED whitelist and can never anchor the safe order. If `manage_schedule_block_status` is a numbered step, `schedule_block` must also be a numbered step placed earlier — booking reachable only through `allowedTools` is rejected. The safe (default) shape is the reverse: `schedule_block` as the terminal step, the cancellation in `allowedTools` as the last movement. In a reschedule flow `schedule_block` must always appear in `steps`.
- Every `flow.intent`, and every id declared in `intents`, must belong to the canonical taxonomy.
- A flow whose intent is `existing_appointment_*` and that uses `manage_schedule_block_status` or `schedule_block` must declare `selection.requiredCapabilities: ["hasActiveAppointment"]`. Informational flows (no tools) do not need it.
- No `responseTemplate` when the terminal step holds only search/resolver tools.
- No `responseTemplate` on a tool-using flow whose terminal step declares no tools (e.g. tools only in `allowedTools`, no `steps`).
- The `steps` array must be written in ascending `step` order.

There are **no silent fallbacks**: any of these produces an explicit, blocking error explaining what is wrong, why it is dangerous and how to fix it. A JSON that fails validation is not loaded at runtime.

## Disambiguation Guide (for Intent Classification)

### Short Replies ("yes", "ok", "sure")
The **last bot message** determines the meaning of short replies.

| Last Bot Message | Patient Reply | Correct Intent |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| "Do you confirm attendance to your appointment?" | "yes" | `existing_appointment_confirmation` |
| "Would you like us to change your appointment to another day?" | "yes" | `existing_appointment_reschedule_inquiry` |
| "Here is the information you requested" | "ok" | `general_inquiry` / acknowledgment |
| "Do you need anything else?" | "no" | acknowledgment (conversation end) |

### Cancelation vs. Reschedule

| Patient Message | Correct Intent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "I can't make it, cancel it" | `existing_appointment_cancellation` |
| "I can't make it, can we move it?" | `existing_appointment_rescheduling` |
| "I won't attend" (reply to reminder) | `existing_appointment_cancellation` |

### New Booking vs. Existing Appointment

| Patient Message | Correct Intent |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "I want a new ultrasound" | `new_appointment_scheduling` |
| "I want to move my Tuesday ultrasound" | `existing_appointment_rescheduling` |
| "When is my appointment?" | `existing_appointment_inquiry` |

## Anti-Pattern Checklist

### "Rule as Shortcut"
**Symptom:** a rule has `action: "create_task"` and a `message`. **Why wrong:** it bypasses the flow; tools never run and the flow's `responseTemplate` is ignored. **Fix:** `action: "allow"` + a flow with a `create_task` step.

### "Keyword Salad"
**Symptom:** a description lists exact words in quotes/brackets. **Why wrong:** the classifier is semantic. **Fix:** rewrite as a natural-language description of intent.

### "Orphan Intent Reference"
**Symptom:** a flow or rule references `intent: "X"` but `intents["X"]` is missing. **Why wrong:** the validator rejects it and the classifier can never select it. **Fix:** declare `X` in the catalog (or fix the reference).

### "Cancel First, Ask Later"
**Symptom:** a reschedule flow uses `manage_schedule_block_status` as its preparatory cancellation, often in parallel with `resolve_availability_query`. **Why wrong:** definitive status management is not the rescheduling contract, and the flow can lose the backend-owned target or cancel before a valid replacement path. **Fix:** use `cancel_for_rescheduling` → `resolve_availability_query` → `check_availability` → `schedule_block` in full mode. Use `manage_schedule_block_status` for definitive cancellation, including non-attendance; offer a new appointment only after the patient accepts it.

### "Closing Template on a Search"
**Symptom:** a flow whose terminal step is `check_availability` / `resolve_*` while declaring `responseTemplate: "He movido tu cita"`. **Why wrong:** the template is the flow's closing line, so the bot claims the change is done right after merely listing slots. **Fix:** end the flow with the acting tool and keep the template there; or drop the template and let the model synthesise the search results.

### "Flow Without Differentiator"
**Symptom:** two flows have semantically overlapping descriptions. **Why wrong:** the classifier cannot distinguish them. **Fix:** add clear differentiators ("NEW" vs. "ALREADY BOOKED", "reserve" vs. "move").
