/**
 * Flow Safety — configuration-time guards against advisor-authored flows that
 * are dangerous or silently broken at runtime.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * `full` and `tasks-only` are only LIMITS (which tools exist at all). The
 * advisor decides, in the chatbot instruction builder JSON, WHICH steps run,
 * IN WHICH ORDER and WITH WHICH TOOLS. The backend therefore cannot assume any
 * particular flow shape — it can only reject shapes that are provably unsafe.
 *
 * Two of those shapes caused a production incident (lead 23415677):
 *
 *  1. The old reschedule flow cancelled the patient's appointment in step 1, in
 *     PARALLEL with resolving the requested dates — i.e. before any
 *     alternative existed. When no slot matched, the patient was left with no
 *     appointment at all. Irrecoverable business data loss.
 *  2. The closing template ("He movido tu cita") was reachable from a flow
 *     whose terminal step was a SEARCH tool, so the model announced the move
 *     right after merely listing availability.
 *
 * Both are configuration mistakes, so they are rejected here — loudly, at
 * configuration time — instead of being silently patched at runtime. Messages
 * are written in Spanish and addressed to a non-technical advisor: what is
 * wrong, why it is dangerous, and how to fix it.
 *
 * Pure functions, no I/O.

 */
export const FLOW_SAFETY_PROMPT_RULES =
  `FLOW SAFETY RULES (the backend validator REJECTS the JSON when any of these is violated):\n` +
  `S1. In a full reschedule flow (intent "existing_appointment_rescheduling") that includes "schedule_block", ` +
  `the preparatory tool MUST be "cancel_for_rescheduling". "manage_schedule_block_status" is NOT a preparatory tool in this flow; ` +
  `use it only for definitive cancellation, confirmation, or EN_ROUTE actions in their respective flows. ` +
  `Conversely, "cancel_for_rescheduling" is ONLY valid in rescheduling flows: definitive cancellation, confirmation ` +
  `and EN_ROUTE flows MUST use "manage_schedule_block_status" instead.\n` +
  `S2. The mandatory full reschedule order is cancel_for_rescheduling -> resolve_availability_query -> check_availability -> schedule_block. ` +
  `EXCEPTION: when the flow declares "selection": { "requiredCapabilities": [..., "hasConcreteDateTime"] } — the patient already ` +
  `gave a concrete date AND time at turn start — "resolve_availability_query" MAY be omitted and the mandatory order becomes ` +
  `cancel_for_rescheduling -> check_availability -> schedule_block. "check_availability" NEVER runs without a concrete date and time: ` +
  `without that capability the resolve step is REQUIRED so the bot asks for the missing date or time. ` +
  `schedule_block also requires availability evidence from the CURRENT turn; inherited slots never authorize booking. ` +
  `If the chosen time is occupied, report that it is no longer available and offer real alternatives, never an expiration explanation. ` +
  `The first tool captures a validated backend target; it is not a definitive cancellation and the final booking reuses the persisted ` +
  `care plan and planned sessions.\n` +
  `S3. A full reschedule flow that includes "schedule_block" MUST include "cancel_for_rescheduling" in numbered steps, and all four ` +
  `tools in S2 MUST appear in that exact numbered order. Under the hasConcreteDateTime exception, "resolve_availability_query" ` +
  `is the only one of the four that may be absent.\n` +
  `S4. "responseTemplateKey" is an optional, denotative reference to the "responseTemplates" registry; it is never patient-facing text. ` +
  `The registry contains the patient-facing text and mode. Do not require a key for any flow, tool, step, or terminal step. ` +
  `When the key is absent, the backend logs the absence and the response uses patientOutcome when available or the AI generates it from context.\n` +
  `S5. Never expose responseTemplateKey values, registry names, tool names, field names, IDs, or other technical identifiers to the patient. ` +
  `Response rendering is independent of step position; steps only describe tool execution order.\n` +
  `S6. Write the "steps" array in execution order: its numbering must be ascending (1, 2, 3...).\n` +
  `S7. Intent ids are FREE except inside two RESERVED namespaces. The clinic owns its conversation: ids like ` +
  `"insurance_coverage_inquiry", "parking_info" or "physio_program_followup" are perfectly valid in "intents" and in ` +
  `"flow.intent", and no rule complains about them. What is CLOSED are the prefixes "new_appointment_" and ` +
  `"existing_appointment_": an id starting with either MUST be one of the canonical ids: ${CANONICAL_INTENTS.join(', ')}. ` +
  `An invented "existing_appointment_moving" LOOKS like rescheduling but is not recognised by the safety rules nor by the ` +
  `server-side guards, so the protection would be silently off. Convention: "new_appointment_*" when the patient does not have ` +
  `the appointment yet, "existing_appointment_*" when the flow reads, moves, confirms, keeps or destroys an appointment the ` +
  `patient already has.\n` +
  `S7b. A flow that CREATES, MOVES or DESTROYS appointments (it uses "${APPOINTMENT_WRITING_TOOLS_TEXT}", in "steps" or in ` +
  `"allowedTools") MUST declare a canonical "intent", even if the flow name is the clinic's own. That flow carries safety ` +
  `semantics and the guards need to classify it. A flow with a free intent and no appointment-writing tools (only ` +
  `"query_knowledge_base", "create_task", "lookup_patient", "check_availability", resolvers...) is valid.\n` +
  `S8. A flow whose intent is "existing_appointment_*" AND that uses an appointment-writing tool MUST ` +
  `declare "selection": { "requiredCapabilities": ["hasActiveAppointment"] }. Without that deterministic gate a bare "sí" can ` +
  `select the flow when the patient has no appointment at all, and the bot acts on an appointment that does not exist. ` +
  `Informational flows (no tools) do not need the gate.\n` +
  `S9. Conversational response templates MUST use model mode. ` +
  `responseTemplates.<key>.mode: "literal" is allowed ONLY for ` +
  `existing_appointment_confirmation, existing_appointment_cancellation, and existing_appointment_delay_notice ` +
  `(confirmation, definitive cancellation, or EN_ROUTE/late notices). A literal mode on an inquiry, farewell, ` +
  `booking, rescheduling, handoff, or informational flow is rejected because it forces a rigid response without ` +
  `adapting to the conversation.\n` +
  `S10. In full mode, a flow whose intent is "existing_appointment_reschedule_inquiry" MUST declare a step with ` +
  `"tools": ["${RESCHEDULE_INQUIRY_REQUIRED_TOOLS.join('", "')}"]. Without them the flow has NO tools at all, so the moment the ` +
  `patient gives a day or a time the bot can only PROMISE to look at the schedule — which is rejected and replaced by a canonical ` +
  `message, advancing nothing, so the patient insists and the bot repeats itself forever. This is CONSULTING, not modifying: the ` +
  `slots it shows are informational and do not authorize booking, and the tools that modify the appointment stay forbidden here. ` +
  `In tasks-only mode this flow declares no tools and the rule does not apply.\n`;

/** Shared semantic contract used by all builder prompts for appointment flows. */
export const RESCHEDULING_SEMANTIC_PROMPT_RULES =
  `RESCHEDULING SEMANTIC RULES (apply these meanings before choosing intents, flows, or tools):\n` +
  `R1. An informational reschedule inquiry asks whether an existing appointment can be rescheduled, without confirming the change. ` +
  `Use canonical intent "existing_appointment_reschedule_inquiry". In full mode it MUST be able to check availability — declare a step with ` +
  `"tools": ["resolve_availability_query", "check_availability"] — so it can tell the patient what options actually exist. Without them the ` +
  `flow has no tools at all and the bot can only PROMISE a search, which is rejected and loops. It must still never cancel, move or book, ` +
  `never promise a future search (check and report instead), and never claim the appointment changed. In tasks-only mode it declares no tools.\n` +
  `R2. An explicit rescheduling confirmation clearly agrees to move the existing appointment. Use canonical intent "existing_appointment_rescheduling" ` +
  `and a separate "reschedule_appointment" flow for the real operation; an inquiry must never be silently upgraded.\n` +
  `R3. definitive non-attendance cancellation means the patient will not attend and wants the existing appointment cancelled, not moved. ` +
  `Use canonical intent "existing_appointment_cancellation" and "manage_schedule_block_status", not "cancel_for_rescheduling"; do not check availability before a new appointment is accepted.\n` +
  `R4. A new appointment after cancellation is a new scheduling request. Use canonical intent "new_appointment_scheduling" and a separate new-appointment flow; never reuse the rescheduling target.\n` +
  `R5. Full and tasks-only are different contracts. In full mode, explicit rescheduling may use availability and appointment tools and must follow the validated full order. In tasks-only mode, do not generate scheduling, rebooking, or availability tools; scheduling requests use "create_task" for human follow-up. Definitive cancellation remains allowed through "manage_schedule_block_status".\n` +
  `R6. Preserve canonical intents exactly. Use verbose internal states such as "PATIENT_ONLY_ASKED_IF_EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_CAN_BE_RESCHEDULED_WITHOUT_CONFIRMING_RESCHEDULING", "PATIENT_EXPLICITLY_CONFIRMED_EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_RESCHEDULING_BEFORE_NEW_DATE_OR_TIME", "EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_WAS_CANCELLED_BECAUSE_PATIENT_WILL_NOT_ATTEND_AND_BOT_IS_OFFERING_A_NEW_APPOINTMENT", and "PATIENT_ACCEPTED_NEW_APPOINTMENT_AFTER_CANCELLING_PREVIOUS_APPOINTMENT" only as internal conversational states, never as new intent ids.\n` +
  `R7. Keep "reschedule_inquiry" and "reschedule_appointment" separate: the first answers whether a change is possible, may show real availability, and requests confirmation; the second performs the confirmed operation. Slots shown during the inquiry are informational and do not authorize booking.\n` +
  `R8. A short affirmative inherits meaning from persisted state: after a reschedule-confirmation question in state PATIENT_ONLY_ASKED_IF_EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_CAN_BE_RESCHEDULED_WITHOUT_CONFIRMING_RESCHEDULING, "sí" means explicit reschedule confirmation and transitions to PATIENT_EXPLICITLY_CONFIRMED_EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_RESCHEDULING_BEFORE_NEW_DATE_OR_TIME; after non-attendance cancellation in state EXISTING_APPOINTMENT_WAS_CANCELLED_BECAUSE_PATIENT_WILL_NOT_ATTEND_AND_BOT_IS_OFFERING_A_NEW_APPOINTMENT, "sí" means acceptance of a new appointment and transitions to PATIENT_ACCEPTED_NEW_APPOINTMENT_AFTER_CANCELLING_PREVIOUS_APPOINTMENT.\n` +
  `R9. A rescheduling target continues only inside a trusted conversation context. distant starts a new conversation and discards the target, operational intent, inherited slots, and prior availability. The active contract has no expiresAt field.\n`;
